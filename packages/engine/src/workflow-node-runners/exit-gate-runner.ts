FNXC:WorkflowExitGate 2026-07-05-00:00:
FN-7579's `exit-gate` node lets a workflow terminate early instead of always
walking to the terminal `end` node the long way (e.g. breaking out of a
brainstorming ask-user/refine loop once the user approves). It is validated
(workflow-ir.ts) to always have a path to `end`, but it is NOT itself an `end`
node — it only routes there.

Contract: `config.condition` is optional and reuses the same shape as a `loop`
node's `exitWhen` (`WorkflowLoopExitCondition`: `output-contains` /
`output-matches`), read against `context[\`input:${condition.nodeId}\`]` — the
same context key an `ask-user` node's answer is published under — so an
exit-gate can gate directly on what the user said. Absent `condition`, the gate
is unconditional and always exits. The runner never throws on a malformed
condition; it degrades to "does not match" so a bad author config can't crash
the walk, it just falls through instead of exiting early.

Routing: the runner returns `outcome: "success"` with `value: "exit"` (match /
unconditional) or `value: "continue"` (no match). Workflow edges select on
`outcome:exit` / `outcome:continue` (or a single unconditional edge, which
matches any `success` outcome) exactly like the existing gate/step-review
outcome-edge convention.
