/**
 * Merge trait behavior (U7, R10) — `@fusion/engine` side.
 *
 * The merge trait turns merge/PR orchestration, merge strategy, squash posture
 * and file-scope enforcement mode into *configuration* over the substrate merge
 * capability (KTD-6). This module owns two things:
 *
 *   1. The merge trait's hook implementations, registered into core's trait
 *      registry via the `registerTraitHookImpl` DI seam (mirrors
 *      `setCreateFnAgent`):
 *        - `onEnter`  → enqueue the task onto the *persisted* merge-request
 *          queue (reuse the store's existing enqueue path). It NEVER awaits a
 *          merge inline; completion is driven by the merge-queue worker loop
 *          (`ProjectEngine.pickNextMergeTaskId` → `aiMergeTask` →
 *          `store.moveTask(id, "done")`) and resolved via the queue, so a
 *          graph walk / transition never blocks on a merge (the plan-002
 *          deadlock hazard).
 *        - `onExit`   → leaving the merge column dequeues a pending request.
 *          The store already performs this in-lock inside `moveTaskInternal`
 *          (`dequeueMergeQueueOnColumnExit`, a private method); the hook
 *          delegates to that existing mechanism rather than reimplementing the
 *          dequeue (see the onExit impl note). It is registered so the registry
 *          resolves a real impl (not a degraded no-op + audit warning).
 *
 *   2. `resolveMergePolicy` — a small read-through resolver consulted by
 *      `merger.ts` at its existing policy-knob read sites. When the
 *      `workflowColumns` flag is ON it reads the merge-trait config from the
 *      task's resolved workflow; otherwise (and when the workflow's merge
 *      trait carries no config, e.g. the built-in default workflow) it falls
 *      back to the existing settings knobs (`directMergeCommitStrategy`,
 *      `mergeStrategy`, scope settings) for back-compat.
 *
 * The three 2026-05-23 lost-work guards stay in `merger.ts` mechanics and are
 * UNREACHABLE from this config (KTD-6 / R10): sibling `fusion/fn-*` merge-target
 * rejection, line-anchored commit attribution, and the no-op-finalize
 * `modifiedFiles` preservation are not gated by any field this resolver
 * exposes.
