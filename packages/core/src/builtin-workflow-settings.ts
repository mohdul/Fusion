/**
 * Built-in workflow settings catalog.
 *
 * `BUILTIN_MOVED_WORKFLOW_SETTINGS` is the U4 moved-key catalog: keys that
 * formerly lived in `DEFAULT_PROJECT_SETTINGS` and are tombstoned by
 * `MOVED_SETTINGS_KEYS`. Defaults should stay aligned with engine fallback
 * literals; intentional product-default changes must update both together.
 *
 * `BUILTIN_TRIAGE_POLICY_SETTINGS` is workflow-native triage/spec policy. These
 * keys never lived in `DEFAULT_PROJECT_SETTINGS`, are NOT part of the U4
 * hard-move migration, must never be added to `MOVED_SETTINGS_KEYS`, and must
 * not appear in project/global settings schemas. Canonical values are inherited
 * from the post-FN-6232 planning prompt: subtask step threshold `7` (not the
 * older engine copy) and packages/modules threshold `3`. Fast-mode policy is
 * workflow-native here too: `leanPlanning` selects the lean planning variant,
 * and `autoApproveSpec` skips the independent spec reviewer.
 *
 * `BUILTIN_REVIEW_REVISION_SETTINGS` is workflow-native review-loop policy.
 * These keys also never lived in project/global settings and intentionally omit
 * declaration defaults: an unset workflow value means unbounded remediation.
 *
 * `BUILTIN_OVERSIGHT_SETTINGS` is workflow-native planner oversight policy.
 * These keys never lived in project/global settings and must never be added to
 * `MOVED_SETTINGS_KEYS`.

/**
 * The moved-key catalog declared as workflow settings (U1, R4).
 *
 * Single source of truth, imported by both built-in workflow IR files
 * (`builtin-coding-workflow-ir.ts`, `builtin-stepwise-coding-workflow-ir.ts`) so
 * the catalog has exactly one definition.
 *
 * Each `default` here must stay aligned with the corresponding engine read-site
 * fallback literal so projects without stored workflow values execute with the
 * same policy the Workflow Editor displays. Keys with `undefined` legacy
 * defaults (the per-phase model lanes) omit `default` entirely, which
 * round-trips to the same effective value.
 *
 * NOTE: these declarations are inert in U1 — nothing reads them until the
 * effective-settings resolver and engine integration land (U3). Adding them does
 * not change any built-in workflow's behavior.
 *
 * Keys deliberately NOT in this catalog (per KTD-4 / the catalog-shrink rule):
 *   - `completionDocumentationMode` — read outside per-task scope (triage), stays
 *     in project settings.
 *   - merge-cluster keys + `maxConcurrent` — owned by the columns/traits track.

- The task affects MORE THAN {{triageSubtaskPackageThreshold}} different packages/modules with distinct concerns (a typed field change that naturally touches core types + store + UI + tests is NOT 4 distinct concerns — it's one coherent change)
- Any single step would take more than 1-2 hours to complete
- The task has multiple clearly independent deliverables that could be developed and shipped in parallel by different people

**Splitting guidance:**
- Even when \`breakIntoSubtasks\` is not set to \`true\`, apply these thresholds proactively
- Keep explicit user intent first: when \`breakIntoSubtasks: true\`, follow the mandatory breakdown flow above
- Size S tasks should NOT be split — the overhead outweighs the benefit
- A task with 7-10 focused steps within a coherent scope is fine as one unit; do not split it
- Coordination overhead (worktrees, dependency wiring, merge sequencing) is real — only split when the parallelism or scope-clarity benefit clearly outweighs it
- If you decide not to split an M/L task, proceed with a normal PROMPT.md specification

**Broad-scope decomposition signals:**
- Size L tasks, especially when the planned step count would reach {{triageSubtaskLargeStepSignal}} or more.
- Plans whose implementation-step count would reach {{triageSubtaskAdditiveStepSignal}} or more (additive signal — counts even when the surrounding step-count threshold above has not yet fired).
- Tasks whose declared \`## File Scope\` would list {{triageSubtaskFileScopeThreshold}} or more entries.
- Descriptions that quantify large remediation batches (for example "47 failing tests", "30+ broken files") at or above {{triageSubtaskRemediationBatchThreshold}} items — treat as a strong signal that the work should be partitioned by subsystem or file group before specifying.
- When two or more of the signals above fire together, default to splitting via \`fn_task_create\`. If you still choose to keep the task as a single unit, justify the decision explicitly in the PROMPT.md \`## Mission\` paragraph.`;
