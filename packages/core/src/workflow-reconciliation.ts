/**
 * Workflow lifecycle reconciliation (U5, R15/R20).
 *
 * Defines the policy for every case where a card's column could stop existing
 * under it:
 *
 *   (a) workflow SWITCH — the task's selection changes. If the new workflow
 *       defines a column with the task's current column id, position is
 *       preserved; otherwise the card re-homes to the new workflow's entry
 *       (intake-flagged, falling back to the first) column. In-flight processing
 *       is aborted first via an injected abort callback (engine wires the real
 *       abort; core ships a safe no-op default + audit entry so core stays
 *       engine-free).
 *
 *   (b) workflow EDIT removing an occupied column — the update path blocks with
 *       a typed {@link OccupiedColumnsError} listing per-column occupant counts.
 *       An explicit `rehomeTo` option allows the save plus re-home of every
 *       occupant (one audit event per card).
 *
 *   (c) workflow DELETE with occupants — built-ins stay blocked; custom
 *       workflows re-home occupants to the DEFAULT workflow's entry column,
 *       clear their selection rows, and preserve task fields (preserveProgress
 *       semantics), one audit event per card.
 *
 * Re-homing moves go through `moveTask` with `moveSource: "engine"` +
 * `bypassGuards` (a recovery-class move, KTD-9) — never a raw column write — so
 * capacity (KTD-10) and the single transition authority (KTD-3) are honored.
 *
 * This module is pure policy + a DI seam. The store (and dashboard routes via
 * the store) own the actual DB reads/writes and the `moveTask` call; this module
 * supplies the column-resolution rules and the abort indirection so the policy
 * is independently testable and reused identically across switch/edit/delete.
