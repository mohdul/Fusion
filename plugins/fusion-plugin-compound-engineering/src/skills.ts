/**
 * Compound Engineering pipeline-stage skills, bundled (pinned) inside the plugin.
 *
 * Each entry's `skillFiles` is plugin-root-relative and points at a `SKILL.md`
 * physically shipped under `src/skills/<skillId>/`. The bundled copy is a pinned
 * snapshot (KTD5) — never a symlink to the global compound-engineering cache —
 * so registering it can never clobber a user's global install (R12).
 *
 * The frontmatter `name` in each bundled SKILL.md equals the directory name
 * (e.g. `ce-brainstorm`), so `skillId === name` here. pi-coding-agent's
 * `loadSkills` derives `Skill.name` from that frontmatter, which is what the
 * engine skill-resolver matches against.
