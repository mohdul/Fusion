Fix pausing behavior for in-review tasks so stop fully halts merge activity. Paused in-review tasks are now marked with paused status, removed from merge queues, active merge sessions are aborted/disposed, self-healing recovery skips paused tasks, and unpausing re-enqueues eligible review tasks for auto-merge.
