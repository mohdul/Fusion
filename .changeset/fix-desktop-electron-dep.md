summary: Fix `fusion desktop` on Windows and published npm installs (Electron dependency, GPU/sandbox flags, dashboard reuse).
category: fix
dev: `packages/cli/package.json` now depends on `electron` at runtime; previously the desktop launcher called `require("electron")`, which is only available inside the source checkout (via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `onlyBuiltDependencies`) and is missing for npm consumers, causing `fusion desktop` to hang or fail silently. The launcher now applies GPU/sandbox-disabling Electron flags only on Windows (`os.platform() === "win32"`), keeps hardware acceleration and the Chromium sandbox on macOS/Linux, exports `FUSION_SERVER_PORT` so the desktop reuses the CLI-started dashboard instead of double-binding ports, and isolates desktop user-data under `~/.fusion/desktop-user-data`. Relocating the profile performs a one-time copy of the previous default Electron profile (`user-data-migration.ts`) so upgrading operators keep window geometry/session. `packages/desktop/scripts/build.ts` now fails the build if `main.js`/`preload.js`/`client/index.html` are missing from `dist/` or the staged `deploy/dist/`, preventing shipping an incomplete `app.asar`.
