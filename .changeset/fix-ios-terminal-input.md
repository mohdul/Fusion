Fix iOS terminal typing in the dashboard. On touch-primary devices, tapping the terminal opened the on-screen keyboard but keystrokes were silently dropped because the bubble-phase `handleTerminalGestureFocus` handler re-focused the helper textarea and reset its selection during touchstart/pointerdown, disrupting iOS's input-event attribution. The CSS fix in commit c7266b7f already positions the textarea to receive taps natively, so the JS handler is now a no-op on `(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` devices and desktop retains click-to-focus.
